## The Problem

Writing notes demands time, mental energy, and focus. By the time you're ready to start revision, exhaustion is inevitable. Last-minute studying becomes especially challenging.

Students across schools often struggle with extracting useful notes from lengthy textbooks and aligning their study material with the official syllabus. 

This leads to:

- Numerous hours wasted on reading irrelevant portions
- Last-minute stress before exams
- Conflicting notes making studies confusing
- Manual note-making becoming time-consuming and overwhelming
